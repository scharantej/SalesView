### **Problem Analysis**
The problem at hand is to build a dashboard that displays the top customers based on data retrieved from Salesforce and stored in BigQuery. To achieve this, we will design a Flask application that fetches the necessary data from BigQuery and presents it in a user-friendly dashboard.

### **Flask Application Structure**
The Flask application will consist of the following components:

#### **HTML Files**
- `index.html`: This will serve as the main page of the application and will contain the dashboard layout.
- `customers.html`: This file will display the list of top customers along with their relevant information.

#### **Routes**
- `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file, serving as the entry point of the application.
- `/customers`: This route will fetch the top customers' data from BigQuery and render the `customers.html` file, displaying the list of customers.

### **HTML Files**
#### **index.html**
This file will contain the basic structure of the dashboard, including the header, navigation bar, and a placeholder for the customers' list.

#### **customers.html**
This file will display the list of top customers in a tabular format. It will include columns for customer name, revenue, and other relevant metrics.

### **Routes**
#### **/**
This route will serve as the entry point of the application. It will render the `index.html` file, which will display the dashboard layout.

#### **customers**
This route will handle the retrieval of top customers' data from BigQuery. It will execute a query to fetch the necessary information and then render the `customers.html` file, passing the retrieved data to be displayed in the table.

### **Additional Considerations**
- The application can be further enhanced by adding features such as pagination, sorting, and filtering to the customers' list.
- To improve security, the application can implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the dashboard.
- For better user experience, the application can incorporate responsive design principles to ensure it adapts well to different devices and screen sizes.

### **Conclusion**
This design provides a solid foundation for building a Flask application that addresses the problem of creating a dashboard to display top customers using Salesforce data stored in BigQuery. By following this structure and implementing the necessary functionality, a functional and user-friendly dashboard can be developed using Python Flask.
